                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
                    <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">Background: Fire is known to affect forest biodiversity, carbon storage, and public health
                    today; however, comparable fire histories from across forest regions in Amazonia are lacking.
                    Consequently, the degree to which past fires could have preconditioned modern forest
                    resilience to fire remains unknown.
                    Aim: We characterised the long-term (multi-millennial) fire history of forests in Amazonia to
                    determine spatial and temporal differences in fire regimes.
                    Methods: We collated and standardised all available charcoal data extracted from continuously
                    deposited lake sediments (n = 31) to reconstruct a ca. 10,000-year fire history for: (i) north
                    and north-western, (ii) south-western, and (iii) eastern parts of Amazonia.
                    Results: Charcoal was found across Amazonia, but it was less abundant in the north and northwestern
                    regions. Regionally distinct periods of elevated charcoal deposition were identified at
                    between ca. 4000 and 1500 (eastern), 3000–1000 (south-western) and 2500–2000 (north and
                    north-western) years ago.
                    Conclusions: Forests in eastern and south-western Amazonia have been exposed to fire
                    activity over recent millennia, while the forests in north and north-western Amazonia have
                    grown under conditions largely free of fire activity. Consequently, we hypothesise that the
                    forests in eastern and south-western Amazonia are preconditioned to be relatively more
                    resilient to the threat of increased modern fire activity.</p>
